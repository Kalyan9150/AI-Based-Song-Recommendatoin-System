# AI-Based-Song-Recommendatoin-System
This project explores the optimization of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)-based AI music recommendation system, enhancing personalized song suggestions by tuning key hyperparameters such as the number of neighbors, distance metrics, and weighting functions. We employed ten optimization techniques—including Grid Search, Simulated Annealing, Differential Evolution, Bayesian Optimization, and Nelder-Mead—to refine the model's predictive performance. Each method's effectiveness was assessed using accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall, followed by a comparative analysis and visual result representation. The optimized KNN model, saved for deployment, demonstrates how strategic hyperparameter tuning can significantly improve user experience in AI-driven music streaming platforms.
